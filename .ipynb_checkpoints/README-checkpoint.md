GDPMaps

This repo shares my explorations with creating maps using geopandas. Originally motivated by a desire to create maps for an Islamic History class as well maps for COCC's Study Abroad program in Barcelona during spring of 2022. Barca has a lovely open database for all sorts of gis data about the city. Lots of great learning in this exercise. Gonna be fun.
