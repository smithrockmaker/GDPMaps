## GDPMaps

This repo shares my explorations with creating maps using geopandas. Originally motivated by a desire to create maps for an Islamic History class as well maps for COCC's Study Abroad program in Barcelona during spring of 2022. Barca has a lovely open database for all sorts of gis data about the city. Lots of great learning in this exercise. Gonna be fun.

### Barcelona

These are notebooks and data from the Barcelona open data site as I explore accessing and manipulating various forms of files.

### MiddleWorld

These are notebooks and data for creating a workable map of the Middle World that we explored in my Islamic history class. Different data and plotting issues here.

### General

These notebooks are more general explorations that started me down this road.
